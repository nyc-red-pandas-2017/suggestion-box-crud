In "/app/controllers/suggestion"  Why does route order dependency mater in these catching?


In Suggerstion migration file, is the validations on t.reference redundent?


In User model was able to validate a min. password length but was unable to figure out how, if we have to, do so in the user migration file


In the "/views/users/show" I load @suggestions = Suggestion.all in the route and conditionally iterate through, is there a better way to do this?  Loading and sending all the suggestions seems insecure and with scale ineffiecent.


Need Help implimenting the up_vote functionalitly.  I believe the forms work but have been unable to test them for I could not get the conditional display to work properly found in "/views/up_votes/_up_date"


ActiveRecord associations unquie (object is an array and could use that later), but is there a way code in that type of parameter (ex. Currenetly suppoerters from the User model will produce duplicates)
