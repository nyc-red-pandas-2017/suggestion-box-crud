In "/app/controllers/suggestion"  Why does route order dependency mater in these catching?

In Suggerstion migration file, is the validations on t.reference redundent?

In User model was able to validate a min. password length but was unable to figure out how, if we have to, do so in the user migration file

In the "/views/users/show" I load @suggestions = Suggestion.all in the route and conditionally iterate through, is there a better way to do this?  Loading and sending all the suggestions seems insecure and with scale ineffiecent.
